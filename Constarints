SQl constarints are used to specify rules for the data in table and are used to limit the type of data tht can go into table this ensures accuracy and reliabitity of data in
table.
 Commonly used Constarits are:1

1.UNIQUE-This ensures all values in coloumn are diff from each other, promoting iniqueness
CREATE TABLE Employee 
(
 EmployeeID INT UNIQUE,
  Name VARCHAR(100) 
);
2.NOT NULL - It prevents coloumn from having a NULL vlue,ensuring that field lways contains data
EX: emp_name , email
CREATE TABLE Employee 
(
EmployeeID INT NOT NULL,
Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

3.PRIMARY KEY- Combines UNIQUE and NOT NULL , it uniquely identifies each row in a table 
and must contain a unique value that cannot be null.
CREATE TABLE Employee
(
EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL 
);

EX: practical Application of SQL constarints
Create table Employees(
EmpID INT PRIMARYKEY,
NAME VARCHAR(50) not null,
email VARCHAR (100) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);


UNIQUE-ensures that all values in a column are distinct.
NOT NULL - requires that a column cannot have a NULL value, crucial for important data.
PRIMARY KEY - uniquely identifies each row in a table.
CHECK - sets specific rules for the values that can appear in a column.
DEFAULT - provides a fallback value for a column when no other data is entered.
FOREIGN KEY - connects tables and ensures changes in one table are accurately reflected in another.
