NULL-->The IS NULL operator is used to identify rows where a specific column has missing or undefined data, which is different from an empty string or zero, which are actual
values. The IS NOT NULL operator is used to find rows where a specific column has non-NULL values.
When to use IS NULL:
To identify records with missing information.
To filter out incomplete data entries.
To perform operations or corrections on rows where specific data is absent.

NOT NULL->The IS NOT NULL operator is used to retrieve rows where a specific column does not have NULL values. This helps in finding records with complete information,
ensuring certain columns have valid entries before processing or analyzing the data, and filtering out rows where important data is missing.
When to use IS NOT NULL:
To identify records with complete information.
To verify certain columns have valid entries before processing or analyzing the data.
To filter out rows where critical data is missing.
